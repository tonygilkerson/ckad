The [Fundamentals of Kubernetes (LFS258) course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-courses/system-administration-training/kubernetes-fundamentals) builds on this introductory material and is designed as preparation for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam.

The topics covered in the [Kubernetes for Developers (LFS259) course](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-for-developers/) are directly aligned with the knowledge domains tested by the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer Exam.
